### Architecture Pattern

The application follows MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture with Provider pattern:

- **Models** - Define data structures (CoFounder, Expense, Settlement) with complete serialization/deserialization
- **Database** - DatabaseHelper singleton manages all SQLite operations
- **State Management** - ExpenseProvider uses ChangeNotifier for reactive updates
- **Views** - Flutter screens build UI based on provider state
- **Theme** - Centralized Material Design 3 styling

## Data Models

### CoFounder
- Unique identifier (UUID)
- Name, email, phone number
- Role/designation within startup
- Bank account details (bank name, account number, IFSC code)
- Target contribution amount for financial planning
- Avatar color for visual identification
- Creation timestamp
- Active status flag

### Expense
- Unique identifier (UUID)
- Description and detailed notes
- Amount and currency
- Category from predefined list
- Payer (CoFounder who paid)
- Contributors list (team members to split with)
- Company fund flag (true for company expenses, false for personal)
- Company name if company fund expense
- Date of transaction
- Optional receipt attachment
- Creation timestamp

### Settlement
- Unique identifier (UUID)
- From (debtor) CoFounder
- To (creditor) CoFounder
- Amount to settle
- Date of settlement
- Notes for reference
- Settlement status (pending/completed)

## Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE cofounder (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  phone TEXT,
  role TEXT,
  avatarColor TEXT,
  bankName TEXT,
  bankAccountNumber TEXT,
  bankIFSC TEXT,
  targetContribution REAL,
  createdAt TEXT,
  isActive INTEGER DEFAULT 1
);

CREATE TABLE expense (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  category TEXT NOT NULL,
  amount REAL NOT NULL,
  paidById TEXT NOT NULL,
  contributorIds TEXT NOT NULL,
  isCompanyFund INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  companyName TEXT,
  date TEXT NOT NULL,
  notes TEXT,
  receipt TEXT,
  createdAt TEXT,
  FOREIGN KEY (paidById) REFERENCES cofounder(id)
);

CREATE TABLE settlement (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  fromId TEXT NOT NULL,
  toId TEXT NOT NULL,
  amount REAL NOT NULL,
  date TEXT NOT NULL,
  notes TEXT,
  settled INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  FOREIGN KEY (fromId) REFERENCES cofounder(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (toId) REFERENCES cofounder(id)
);
```

## Getting Started

## Application Navigation

The app uses bottom navigation with five main sections:

1. **Dashboard** - Overview with key metrics and recent activity
   - Total expenses display
   - Company fund vs personal breakdown
   - Real-time team member balances
   - Team size and transaction counts

2. **Expenses** - Transaction management interface
   - Complete list of all expenses
   - Category-based filtering
   - Company fund indicator
   - Edit/delete capabilities
   - Add new expense dialog

3. **Co-founders** - Team member management
   - View all team members with profiles
   - Display roles and designations
   - Visual identification via avatar colors
   - Quick access to bank details
   - Add new team member dialog

4. **Reports** - Three-tab analytics dashboard
   - Overview tab: Key metrics with charts
   - By Person tab: Individual contributions and balances
   - By Category tab: Spending breakdown by category
   - Professional visualizations with pie and bar charts

5. **Settlements** - Account settlement tracking
   - Identify required settlements
   - Record completed payments
   - Settlement history with dates
   - Payment status tracking

## Workflow Example

1. Add co-founders to establish the team
2. Record expenses as they occur
3. Specify who paid and who benefits from the expense
4. System automatically calculates individual balances
5. View settlement requirements in Settlements tab
6. Record payments when transfers occur
7. Monitor spending trends in Reports section

## Balance Calculation Algorithm

The system calculates individual balances using the following algorithm:

```
For each expense:
  1. Identify payer and all contributors
  2. Calculate per-person share: amount / contributor_count
  3. Update payer balance: +amount (money received)
  4. Update each contributor balance: -share (money owed)
  5. Apply company fund flag appropriately

Final balance interpretation:
  Positive: Team member should receive refund
  Negative: Team member owes money to settle debts
  Zero: Fully settled
```

## Expense Categories

- Office Supplies - Stationery, equipment, furniture
- Equipment - Hardware, machinery, devices
- Software & Tools - Licenses, subscriptions, software
- Marketing - Advertising, branding, promotions
- Travel - Flights, hotels, transportation
- Utilities - Internet, electricity, phone
- Rent/Space - Office rent, workspace fees
- Food & Beverage - Meals, catering, refreshments
- Professional Services - Consulting, legal, accounting
- Other - Miscellaneous expenses

## Performance Optimization

- Efficient ListView.builder for large transaction lists
- Lazy loading on screen navigation
- Optimized database queries with proper indexing
- Minimal widget rebuilds through Provider architecture
- Asynchronous database operations prevent UI blocking
- Smart caching of calculated balances

## Data Persistence

All application data is stored locally in SQLite database:
- **Android**: `/data/data/com.skyryse.ryse_two/databases/ryse_two.db`
- **iOS**: Application Documents folder
- **Web**: Browser IndexedDB
- **Windows/Linux/macOS**: Application data directory

To backup data, backup the device or application directory. No cloud synchronization exists in the current version.

## Known Limitations

- Single database instance (no multi-company support)
- Local data only (no cloud synchronization)
- No multi-user authentication
- No recurring expense templates
- No budget tracking or spending alerts
- No receipt image storage in current version
- Single team setup per installation

## Future Enhancements

- Cloud synchronization with Firebase
- User authentication across devices
- Multi-company support for diversified portfolios
- Recurring expense automation
- Advanced budget tracking and alerts
- Trend analysis and forecasting
- Expense categorization AI
- Receipt image OCR processing
- Export functionality (PDF, CSV, Excel)
- Web dashboard interface
- Mobile app store deployment
- Expense approval workflows
- Payment gateway integration

## Configuration

### Application Settings
- Expense categories: `lib/constants/app_constants.dart`
- Color scheme: `lib/theme/app_theme.dart`
- Database name: DatabaseHelper.databaseName
- Avatar colors: AddCoFounderDialog._avatarColors

### Build Configuration
- App name: ryse_two (pubspec.yaml)
- App version: 1.0.0+1
- Minimum Android SDK: 21 (API Level 21)
- Target Android SDK: 33+
- iOS minimum deployment: 11.0

## Troubleshooting

**Database errors on startup:**
- Delete app and reinstall to reset database
- Check SQLite version compatibility with sqflite

**Icon not updating on Android:**
- Clean build: `flutter clean && flutter pub get`
- Rebuild app to apply new icons from flutter_launcher_icons

**UI performance issues:**
- Reduce number of historical transactions displayed
- Check device storage space
- Review app permissions (Storage, Calendar, etc.)

**Provider state not updating:**
- Ensure ExpenseProvider is properly initialized in main.dart
- Check Consumer widgets are properly wrapped around state-dependent UI
